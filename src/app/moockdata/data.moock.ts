      paragraph1: 'It is the first thing your manager asks as you present your latest work. How do you answer? Do you refer to the mean squared error? the R² coefficient? How about some example results? These are all great, but I would like to add another technique to your toolkit — confidence intervals.',
      paragraph2: 'At the end of the day, one of the most important jobs any data scientist has is to help people trust an algorithm that they most likely don’t completely understand.',
      paragraph3: 'One way to help build this trust is to add confidence intervals to your model\'s predictions. We will define confidence intervals for this article as a way of quantifying the uncertainty of an estimate. This tends to be easier for classification problems. Most algorithms provide probability estimates which can serve as confidence scores. For example, a 90% probability of being a cat should be more confident than a 50% probability.',
      paragraph4: 'For regression problems, though, things tend to get trickier. Most algorithms don’t have a natural way of providing a confidence or probability score. There are many solutions to this problem, one of my favorite being Bayesian models, but I would like to discuss the simplest and easiest method to implement for any machine learning model.',
